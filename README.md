# Hate-speech-Detection
This is my internship project in 1stop ai as data science 
Hate Speech Detection Project
This repository contains code for a hate speech detection project using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to classify tweets into categories: hate speech detected, offensive language detected, and no hate/offensive speech.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing steps include lowercasing, removal of URLs, punctuation, and stopwords, as well as stemming.
Model Training: Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier are trained on the preprocessed tweet data.
Model Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are calculated to evaluate model performance.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is stored in the twitter_data.csv file. It contains labeled tweets categorized into different classes.

How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK).
3. Run the hate_speech_detection.py script to execute data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
4. Explore the results and model accuracies provided.
